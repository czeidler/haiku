Greetings.

This document is intended to serve as an introduction to the Haiku project.
As such, this is only the tip of the iceberg.


About the Haiku project
-----------------------
The Haiku project is comprised of numerous volunteers spread across the globe.
While Haiku supports localization efforts, the primary language is English.
The project is mindful of the language barrier for non-English speakers. To
note, the native language of the majority of contributors is not English.


Design goals
------------
If the ideology of the Haiku project were to be explained in a few short words,
it would be something like this. The software shall have sensible defaults with
minimal configuration required. The code shall adhere to the coding guidelines
and implement the functionality in best possible manner.


Haiku project website
---------------------
http://www.haiku-os.org

This is the main website for the Haiku project. It contains news posts from
the project, blog posts (from developers, Google Summer of Code participants,
and other frequent contributors), forums, and a vast collection of information.


Communication
-------------
http://www.haiku-os.org/community/ml
http://www.haiku-os.org/community/ml/etiquette

The primary means of communication are through mailing lists and are generally
hosted by FreeLists. In addition to the mailing lists (ML), numerous users and
contributors frequent IRC (irc.freenode.net#haiku). There is also BeShare, an
online chat and file sharing application.

http://dev.haiku-os.org/

This is the Haiku project's development tracker.
 * Bug reports
 * Browse the source
 * Review changesets
 * Development related wiki (limited write access)


{OpenGrok
---------
http://haiku.it.su.se:8180/source
http://grok.bikemonkey.org/source
http://code.metager.de/source/xref/haiku
https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ahaiku%2Fhaiku&type=Code

Graciously provided by Janne Johansson, Landon Fuller and MetaGer respectively.
This allows you to quickly and easily search Haiku's source code.
GitHub, while not {OpenGrok, also provides search functionality.


Coding Guidelines
------------------
http://www.haiku-os.org/development/coding-guidelines

The Haiku project takes pride in code quality. Both in terms of implementing
the correct code, as well as ensuring the code is written in a consistent
style. Learning and utilizing the coding guidelines is essential to
contributing code to Haiku.


Haiku API documentation
-----------------------
http://api.haiku-os.org
Old BeBook API: http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/bebook

This is the current (and in-progress) documentation for Haiku's API. As Haiku
was formed on the idea of implementing binary compatibility with BeOS R5, the
BeBook is fairly accurate. Contributions to Haiku's API book are encouraged.


Learning to Program with Haiku
------------------------------
http://www.haiku-os.org/development/learning_to_program_with_haiku

A developer, DarkWyrm has published a book that is " aimed at people who want
to be able to write simple programs to get stuff done, but never had anyone
around teach them". He has chosen to distribute the PDF versions of the book
under a Creative Commons license for noncommercial purposes.


Programming with Haiku
----------------------
http://www.haiku-os.org/tags/programmingwithhaiku

Another series from Darkwyrm. It is "aimed at current codemonkeys who want to
break into development for Haiku. Here begins a new series of programming
lessons aimed at people who already have a basic grasp on C++: Programming with
Haiku."


ohloh
-----
http://www.ohloh.net/p/haiku

"Ohloh is a free public directory of open source software and people." On
there, you can view detailed reports and analysis of Haiku (and other open
source software projects).
