	\class BIconUtils
	\ingroup interface
	\ingroup libbe
	\brief The BIconUtils class provide utility methods for managing and
		drawing vector icons.

	Haiku icons are stored in the HVIF (Haiku Vector Icon Format). This format
	was designed specifically for this purpose, and allows the icon data to be
	small enough to fit in file's inodes. This way, the icon can be displayed
	like any other file attribute, without extra disk access.

	This class provide only static methods to allow access to the icon data and
	rendering to BBitmaps for later use in an application. It also supports
	older icons in bitmap format. These may still be useful at very small
	sizes. Note you can't create an instance of BIconUtils, just call the
	static methods.

	\brief Utility function to import an icon from a node.

	Utility function to import an icon from the node that
	has either of the provided attribute names. Which icon type
	is preferred (vector, small or large B_CMAP8 icon) depends
	on the colorspace of the provided bitmap.

	\note If the colorspace is B_CMAP8, B_CMAP8 icons are preferred. In that
		case, the bitmap size must also match the provided icon_size "size"!

	\brief Utility function to import a vector icon in "flat icon" format.

	Utility function to import a vector icon in "flat icon"
	format from a BNode attribute into the preallocated BBitmap \a result.
	The colorspace of result needs to be B_RGBA32 or at
	least B_RGB32 (though that makes less sense). The icon
	will be scaled from it's "native" size of 64x64 to the
	size of the bitmap.

	\note The scale is derived from the bitmap width, the bitmap should have
		square dimension, or the icon will be cut off at the bottom (or have
		room left).
