	\class BAbstractLayout
	\ingroup interface
	\ingroup layout
	\ingroup libbe

	\brief BLayout subclass providing convenience methods for derived
	implementations.

	This class is designed to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to
	write a BLayout subclass. In most cases, you classes should derive from
	BAbstractLayout rather than BLayout.

	When a BAbstractLayout is attached to a BView, many of the methods provided
	by the BAbstractLayout class are forwarded to the BAbstractLayout's
	owner BView. When a BAbstractLayout is viewless, these methods are handled
	locally.

	\warning This class is not yet finalized, if you use it in your software
	assume that it will break some time in the future.
