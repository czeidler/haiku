	\class BAlert
	\ingroup interface
	\ingroup libbe
	\brief The BAlert class defines a modal alert dialog which displays a short
		message and provides a set of labeled buttons that allow the user to
		respond.

	The alert can be configured with a set of one to three buttons. These
	buttons are assigned indexes 0, 1, and 2 from right-to-left respectively
	and are automatically positioned by the system. The user can either click
	on one of the buttons or use a shortcut key to select a button.

	The layout of the buttons can be configured by setting the #button_width
	and #button_spacing properties in the BAlert constructor. The icon displayed
	in the alert can also be configured by setting the #alert_type property. The
	right-most button (index 0) is the default button which can be activated
	by pushing the \key{Enter} key.

	Below is an example of an unsaved changes alert dialog:

	\image html BAlert_example.png

	When the user responds by selecting one of the buttons the alert window is
	removed from the screen. The index of the selected button is returned to
	the calling application and the BAlert object is deleted.

	The code used to create and display an alert dialog like the one shown
	above is shown below:

\code
BAlert* alert = new BAlert("Close and save dialog", "Save changes to...",
    "Cancel", "Don't save", "Save", B_WIDTH_AS_USUAL, B_OFFSET_SPACING,
    B_WARNING_ALERT);
alert->SetShortcut(0, B_ESCAPE);
int32 button_index = alert->Go();
\endcode

	The messaged displayed in the dialog window along with the button labels
	are set by the strings in the contructor. The Cancel button is offset to
	the left relative to the other buttons by setting the \c B_OFFSET_SPACING
	flag.  The \c B_WARNING_ALERT flag displays the exclamation mark icon in
	the dialog.

	Any alert with a Cancel button should map the \key{Escape} key as shown in
	the example above. You can setup additional shortcut keys for the buttons
	with the SetShortcut() method.

	The Go() method does the work of loading up and removing the alert
	window and returns the index of the button that the user selected.
