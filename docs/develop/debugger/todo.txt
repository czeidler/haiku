- Need the ability to save crash reports.
- CLI needs to be more fully implemented.
- General expression evaluation parser. Once implemented, should supplant the primitive one currently used for C/C++ typecasting support, as well as being exposed for user expression input.
- Conditional breakpoint/watchpoints. Contingent on above general expression parser.
- Remote debug interface support.
- Kernel debug support.
- Architecture needs to be able to report back the hardware debugging capabilities/limitations of the target platform.
- WatchpointManager needs to be able to use the aforementioned information from Architecture in order to more intelligently
  manage/restrict watchpoint usage (especially once expression watchpoints come into play).
- More complete DWARF3/4 support.
- x86-64 support.
- Support for retrieving/displaying function return values (arch-specific).
- Syntax highlighting in source view.
- Detection of mouse hovering over a variable in SourceView and showing value in tooltip (probably requires expression parsing support).
