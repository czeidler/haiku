		"1)   If you are installing Haiku onto real hardware (not inside an "
		"emulator) it is recommended that you have already prepared a hard "
		"disk partition. The Installer and the DriveSetup tool offer to "
		"initialize existing partitions with the Haiku native file system, "
		"but the options to change the actual partition layout may not have "
		"been tested on a sufficiently great variety of computer "
		"configurations so we do not recommend using it.\n");
	infoText << B_TRANSLATE(
		"If you have not created a partition yet, simply reboot, create the "
		"partition using whatever tool you feel most comfortable with, and "

		"example use the GParted Live-CD, it can also resize existing "
		"partitions to make room.\n\n\n");
	infoText << B_TRANSLATE(
		"2)   The Installer will make the Haiku partition itself bootable, "

		"menu. Depending on what version of GRUB you use, this is done "
